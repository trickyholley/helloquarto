## Hello Quarto from Tricky! 💛

Apparently Quarto is a multi-language publishing system that is popular with data scientists! Who'da thunk? This basic page is just me trying out Posit's Connect Cloud.

```r
addressee <- "Quarto"
addressor <- "Tricky"
cat("Hello", addressee, "from", paste0(addressor, "!"))
```

`Hello Quarto from Tricky!`
